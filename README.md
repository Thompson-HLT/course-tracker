# course-tracker
A app/ website where someone can track assignments, due dates, and tests for multiple courses

## Planning:
The plan is for it to contain a "overall" look at all due dates or important school dates that happen withen the day, week, and month. As well as a tracker (for those aplicable) on their status (complete, not started, working, etc)

Menus for each of the above catagories (due that day, week, and month) that would contain a tab/ bubble for a assignment, test, etc with its full due date (day and time) and status. Once a bubble was completed it would be removed from its associated menus and move to a seprate menu contataining all completed/ finished bubbles (which would be located at the bottom of the page or seprate tab). If a bubble becomes past its due date it goes to a seprate menu for all past due bubbles. Each of these menus could be "opened" or "closed" (like a drop down menu) to make viewing easier. 

Two special menus, which will always be open; one for "marked" bubbles (which will apear regardless of its due date) for important long term assignments, bubbles which are marked will still appear in the above menus with a special star to mark its status. The other for above mentioned past due bubbles.
